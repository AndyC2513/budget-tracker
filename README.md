# Finance Project

## CPSC 210 Project by Andy Chen

Like many other people, I find managing and budgeting my spending each month to be extremely important but a tedious
task. Online digital payments popularized online subscription services of different platforms. This is why my project
will be an application to **record budgets and personal
finances.** Enter type of finance, budget for each type of finance, amount of available funds for each *type of
finance*. Under each type of finance, there are different type of spending projects. Possible features are
*subscription
management* where it tracks subscription based payments and the user can choose to whether continue or cancel them
each month. In
addition, another feature could be a *budget alert* where once the available funds drop below a certain threshold, the
user will be reminded of their budget.

- Vehicle Finance
- Amazon Prime Subscription

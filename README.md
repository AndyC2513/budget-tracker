# Finance Project

## CPSC 210 Project by Andy Chen

Like many other people, I find managing and budgeting my spending each month to be extremely important but a tedious
task. Online digital payments popularized online subscription services of different platforms. On top of that, there
are payments on everyday necessities. This is why my project will be an application to **record budgets and personal
finances.** Enter type of finance, budget for each type of finance, amount of available funds for each *type of
finance*. Under each type of finance, there are different type of spending projects. Possible features are
*subscription
management* where it tracks subscription based payments and the user can choose to whether continue or cancel them
each month. In
addition, another feature could be a *budget alert* where once the available funds drop below a certain threshold, the
user will be reminded of their budget.

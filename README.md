# Finance Project

## CPSC 210 Project by Andy Chen

Like many other people, I find managing and budgeting my spending each month to be extremely important but a tedious
task. Online digital payments popularized online subscription services of different platforms. This is why my project
will be an application to **record budgets and personal
finances.** Users can add new subscriptions and expenses into *a list of different expenses*. They can then choose to
either *pay* or *remove* each subscription or expense. In addition, the user can also *increase the budget of each list*

**Possible X Classes (Subscription):**

- Netflix Subscription
- YouTube Premium Subscription
- Spotify Premium Subscription
- Vehicle Finance
- Amazon Prime Subscription

**Possible Y Classes (SubscriptionList):**

- Academic expenses
- Entertainment subscription
- Living expenses
